# SpaceApartment-ACardboardExperience

## What is this? ##
This project is an experiment to VR without direct hand interaction. As VR controllers and hand tracking grow more and more popular, I want to go back to the basics as well as explore the potential of head movements and eye gaze as means of interaction methods, and see if I can borrow any into my future VR projects. 

The setting of the VR experience is in an apartment somewhere in space. I chose this as the background not only because the futuristic element but also because I can explore some more methods of locomotion.
